Americans are people who insist on living in the present, tense.
He who hoots with owls by night cannot soar with eagles by day.
You never go anywhere without your soul.
Employees must wash hands before returning to work.
Your mode of life will be changed to ASCII.
If food be the music of love, eat up, eat up.
A bird in the hand is worth what it will bring.
If you continually give you will continually have.
The more things change, the more they stay insane.
When the going gets tough, the tough go shopping.
